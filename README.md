# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

### Learning objectives
- Generate random outcomes
- If statements
- Coming up with a basic algorithm from scratch


_________________________
### How can I make this?
- [X] Use this MD to plan the game from the start!
- [X] Using an array for the RPSLS?
- [] Select RPSLS from a row of appropriate images
- [X] Button to randomize the "opponent" choice
- [] Using if/else arguments for the winner?
- [] An element for displaying player/opponent scores after each round
- [] Button to play next round after results
    this must be disabled until a round is complete
- [] See if this could be made into an app using Framework7 or alternative (final goal)
- [] Function A for player win Function B for player lose Function C for tie
- [] Win func adds playerScore++, Lose opponentScore++, tie no change

### Steps taken:

- [X] Making all elements, IDs, classes clear & readable
